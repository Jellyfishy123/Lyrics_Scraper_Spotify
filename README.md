### **About:**
I was instructed by my supervisor to scrap the song lyrics for Vietnamese songs. We needed a few hundred songs so it is not feasible to manually download the songs. I found this program and made some changes to it to suit my needs, where I can save the songs as text files into specific folders of the song artist name, instead of just printing them out onto the console. However, this program did not seem to work for me and I did not managed to print out the lyric for the songs I want. I was only able to analyse and pre-process the songs.
